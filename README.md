# minimodem_chatbot
Dependencies

1.) bash

2.) minimodem

3.) w3m (if you want the google command to work)


All you have to do is just pick channel, and rate. This is made to work with my minimodem chat script
This chatbot has the ability to clear the screen, go to the google webpage, show the manual, and has a help command (which shows "there is not one at the moment)
